         *
         * A match is computed according to these rules:
         * 1. When [`DocumentSelector`](#DocumentSelector) is an array, compute the match for each contained `DocumentFilter` or language identifier and take the maximum value.
         * 2. A string will be desugared to become the `language`-part of a [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter), so `"fooLang"` is like `{ language: "fooLang" }`.
         * 3. A [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter) will be matched against the document by comparing its parts with the document. The following rules apply:
         *  1. When the `DocumentFilter` is empty (`{}`) the result is `0`
         *  2. When `scheme`, `language`, or `pattern` are defined but one doesn’t match, the result is `0`
         *  3. Matching against `*` gives a score of `5`, matching via equality or via a glob-pattern gives a score of `10`
         *  4. The result is the maximum value of each match
         *
         * Samples:
         * ```js
         * // default document from disk (file-scheme)
         * doc.uri; //'file:///my/file.js'
