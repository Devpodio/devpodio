# Theia - Cpp Extension

This extension uses [Clangd](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html) to
provide LSP features.

To install Clangd on Ubuntu 18.04:

    $ wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
    $ echo "deb http://apt.llvm.org/bionic/ llvm-toolchain-bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm.list
    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y clang-tools-8
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/clangd-8 /usr/bin/clangd

See [here](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html#id4) for detailed
installation instructions.

## Getting accurate diagnostics

To get accurate diagnostics, it helps to:

1. Have the build system of the C/C++ project generate a
   [`compile_commands.json`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html)
   file.
2. Point Clangd to the build directory containing said `compile_commands.json`.

Step \#2 can be done using the `cpp.buildConfigurations` preference. In your
home or your project `.theia/settings.json`, define one or more build
configurations:

    {
        "cpp.buildConfigurations": [{
            "name": "Release",
            "directory": "/path/to/my/release/build"
        },{
            "name": "Debug",
            "directory": "/path/to/my/debug/build"
        }]
    }

You can then select an active configuration using the `C/C++: Change Build
Configuration` command from the command palette.

## Setting clangd executable path and arguments

The path of the clangd executable to use can be specified by either:

- Setting the `CPP_CLANGD_COMMAND` environment variable
- Setting the `cpp.clangdExecutable` preference in your home or your project
  `.theia/settings.json`:

        {
            "cpp.clangdExecutable": "/path/to/my/clangd/executable"
        }

- Adding clangd to system path. Default value of executable path is set to
  `clangd`

Similarly, the command-line arguments passed to clangd can be specified by
either:

- Setting the `CPP_CLANGD_ARGS` environment variable
- Setting the `cpp.clangdArgs` preference in your home or your project
  `.theia/settings.json`:

        {
            "cpp.clangdArgs": "list of clangd arguments"
        }

## Getting cross-file references to work

You may notice that by default, cross-references across source file boundaries
don't work.  For example, doing a "Go To Definition" on a function defined in a
different source file (different `.c` or `.cpp`) doesn't work, instead it sends
you to the declaration of the function, typically in a header file.

To get this working, you need to enable clangd's global index using the
`--background-index` command-line argument.

        {
            "cpp.clangdArgs": "--background-index"
        }

## Using the clang-tidy linter

Note: This functionality is available when using clangd 9 and later.

You can set the preference 'cpp.clangTidy' to enable the clang-tidy linter included in clangd. When the preference is set, there are two ways to chose which of its built-in checks clang-tidy will use:

- using the preferences:  'cpp.clangTidyChecks'
- using the file '.clang-tidy' . The file is located in the same folder of the files or a parent folder.

Note: using the preference checks will supersede the value found in the .clang-tidy file.

The syntax used to fill the checks can be found at http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/

clang-tidy has its own checks and can also run Clang static analyzer checks. Each check has a name ([see link above for full list](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)). Clang-tidy takes as input the checks that should run, in the form of a comma-separated list of positive and negative (prefixed with -) globs. Positive globs add subsets of checks, negative globs remove them.

There are two ways to configure clang-tidy's checks: through a Theia preference or using a .clang-tidy config file. Here are examples for both:"

    - for the preferences: "cpp.clangTidyChecks": "*,-readability-*"
        - Meaning: enables all list-checks and disable all readability-* checks

    - for the .clang-tidy file: Checks: "-*,readability-*"
        - Meaning: disable all list-checks and enable all readability-* checks
