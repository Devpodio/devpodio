# Theia - Preferences Extension

This package includes preferences implementation for the preferences api defined in `@theia/core`, which provides four preference providers:
- Default Preference, which serves as default values of preferences,
- User Preference for the user home directory, which has precedence over the default values,
- Workspace Preference for the workspace, which has precedence over User Preference, and
- Folder Preference for the root folder, which has precedence over the Workspace Preference

To set
- User Preferences: Create or edit a `settings.json` under the `.theia` folder located either in the user home.
- Workspace Preference: If one folder is opened as the workspace, create or edit a `settings.json` under the root of the workspace. If a multi-root workspace is opened, create or edit the "settings" property in the workspace file.
- Folder Preferences: Create or edit a `settings.json` under any of the root folders.

Example of a `settings.json` below:

```typescript
{
    // Enable/Disable the line numbers in the monaco editor
	"editor.lineNumbers": "off",
    // Tab width in the editor
	"editor.tabSize": 4,
	"files.watcherExclude": "path/to/file"
}
```

Example of a workspace file below:

```typescript
{
   "folders": [
      {
         "path": "file:///home/username/helloworld"
	  },
	  {
         "path": "file:///home/username/dev/byeworld"
      }
   ],
   "settings": {
      // Enable/Disable the line numbers in the monaco editor
	  "editor.lineNumbers": "off",
      // Tab width in the editor
	  "editor.tabSize": 4,
   }
}
```
