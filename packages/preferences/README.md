# Theia - Preferences Extension

This package includes preferences implementation for the preferences api defined in `@devpodio/core`. This provides two preference providers, one for the user home directory, and one for the workspace, which has precedence over the previous one. To set preferences, create or edit a `settings.json` under the `.theia` folder located either in the user home, or the root of the workspace.

Example of a `settings.json` below:

```typescript
{
    // Enable/Disable the line numbers in the monaco editor
	"editor.lineNumbers": "off",
    // Tab width in the editor
	"editor.tabSize": 4,
	"files.watcherExclude": "path/to/file"
}
```
