   A plug-in system supporting VS Code extensions.

 - __Workbench Improvements__

   Theia's workbench shell will be improved, such that the user can drag and drop widgets from the side bar to the main area and vice-versa.

 - __Test Adapter Support__

   Integration with testing frameworks, based on a Test Adapter Protocol.

 - __Robustness and Improved UX__

   We will further work on simplifying Theia and its UI / UX, improve the performance and keep working on bug reports that are rolling in.

 - __More__

   Any contributors might want to work on additional things. At least this happened in 2017 and is likely to increase with a growing community. :)
